Some comments regarding the translation system.

If you want to translate phpBB to a language that isn't available yet please
consider sending this file to support@phpbb.com so we can include that
language in the official release.

Not only the used strings in the code can be translated but the FAQ and the
images can be translated as well. This can be accomplished by adding -language
to the filename. For example:

faq.php  (default)
faq-norwegian.php  (norwegian version)
reply.gif
reply-norwegian.gif

etc..
